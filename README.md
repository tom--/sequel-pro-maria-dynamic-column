# Manage Maria Dynamic Columns in Sequel Pro

If you use [Dynamic Columns](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/dynamic-columns/) in
[Maria 10.0+](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/what-is-mariadb-100/)
and the [Sequel Pro](http://sequelpro.com/) MySQL management tool
then you may find this useful.

### Install

- Download [Maria Dynamic Column.spBundle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tom--/sequel-pro-maria-dynamic-column/master/Bundles/Maria%20Dynamic%20Column.spBundle/command.plist)
- Save it in `~/Library/Application Support/Sequel Pro/Bundles/`  
(In the Finder: ⌘G and enter `~/Library` Navigate from there.)

### Use

Select a row in a table that has a dynamic column blob and run the bundle:

- "Bundles" menu → "Data Table" → "Maria Dynamic Column" 
- *or* shortcut key ⌃\ (control-backslash) which you can change by
[hacking](#hack) in the bundle editor.

That's all.

### For the sophisticated user

It's really very simple if you are used to PHP and MySQL.


#### <a name="hack"></a>Hack

Open the bundle editor in Sequel Pro (⌘⎇⌃B), create a bundle and
copy-paste `src/Maria Dynamic Column.php`. Set the
bundle options as show. Now hack!

#### Edit and save

To edit and save the object back in the DB, fork the repo, why not, and
add something [like this](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor/) perhaps to edit
and maybe something [like that](https://github.com/tom--/dynamic-ar/blob/master/DynamicActiveRecord.php#L323-L357)
to save. (PRs welcome ;-)


#### Requires

The bundle requires PHP 5.4+. Apple provides PHP with OS X but yours may be 5.3 or older.
You can install a newer PHP with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
It's easy to port this bundle to 5.3 but I haven't done it yet. (PRs welcome ;-)


#### See also

If you use the [Yii 2 Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) and Maria Dynamic Columns then try
[yii2-dynamic-ar](https://github.com/tom--/dynamic-ar).

If you use PHP and not Yii, you should at least try out its
[Active Record ORM](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-db-active-record.html).
It's really good.

Otherwise, consider extending your favorite ORM for Maria Dynamic Columns to spread the
love of this fine technology.
